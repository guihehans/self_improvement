@function:

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring which has no repeating characters.

Input: String="aabccbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring without any repeating characters is "abc".

Input: String="abbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring without any repeating characters is "ab".

Input: String="abccde"
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest substrings without any repeating characters are "abc" & "cde".


the problem can be described as:
Find the longest sub string, within it each character occurs only once.
