@file: Subarrays with Product Less than a Target.py
@time: 2020/8/4 15:58
@function:

Given an array with positive numbers and a target number,
find all of its contiguous sub_arrays whose product is less than the target number.

Input: [2, 5, 3, 10], target=30
Output: [2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]
Explanation: There are six contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.

Input: [8, 2, 6, 5], target=50
Output: [8], [2], [8, 2], [6], [2, 6], [5], [6, 5]
Explanation: There are seven contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.
